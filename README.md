# Evaluation of metrics for code generation
This repository will contain code to run the existing approaches to code generation on multiple datasets.

## Labeling the data
To participate in data labeling, please follow these steps:
* Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/metrics-evaluation.git`
* Run `python rate.py --filename to-grade/all-singles.json`
* Follow the instructions in CLI!
* When you are finished, send us your `to-grade/all-singles.json` or `to-grade/all-singles.tmp.json` file.
* Any contribution is very-very valuable, so don't hesitate to send the files with any amount of labels!
